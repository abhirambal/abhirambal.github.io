title: About
---

I am Abhiram, an aspiring computer scientist, 
pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the 
[School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu).
 
My interests are low-level kernel hacking, systems programming and hard-real time 
embedded system design.

I work with Professor [Anton Burtsev](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~aburtsev) in the
[XCap](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xcap) project to decompose Linux kernel.

Here is my latest [CV](http://abhirambal.github.io/Abhiram_B.pdf)
