I am Abhiram, an aspiring computer scientist working as a Firmware engineer at Ubiquiti Networks (Draper, UT). 
I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu), Utah.
 
My interests are low-level kernel hacking, systems programming and hard-real time embedded system design.

Here is my latest [CV](http://abhirambal.github.io/Abhiram_B.pdf)
