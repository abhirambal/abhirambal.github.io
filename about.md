---

I am Abhiram (people prefer calling me Abhi), an aspiring computer scientist, 
pursuing masters in Computer Science at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu). 
My interests are low-level kernel hacking, systems programming and hard-real time embedded system design.

I work with Professor [Anton Burtsev](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~aburtsev) in the
[XCap](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xcap) project to decompose Linux kernel.
