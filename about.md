title: About

I often go by the moniker "AB" (or) sometimes "Abi" as people find it much easier to call me that way.

I am an aspiring computer scientist, pursuing masters in Computer Science at the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu), as keen as mustard about low-level kernel hacking, systems programming and hard-real time embedded system design.

I am also a Graduate Research Assistant and I work with Professor [Anton Burtsev](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~aburtsev) in [XCap](https://www.flux.utah.edu/project/xcap) project.

Previously, I was employed with [Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions](http://www.bosch-india-software.com/en/homepage/rbei_homepage.html) as a Senior Software Engineer where I worked for the Linux-internal Center of Competence close to 2 years. Prior to that, I started my career at an embedded systems startup company where I worked for [BnR automation Gmbh](http://www.br-automation.com/en-us/perfection-in-automation/) close to around 2.5 years.
